  "description" : "The MM4-A \"Wasp,\" a mech for the space-faring Avali!\n\n[u][b]Note (Important):[/b] Currently no XS Mechs: Modular Edition compatibility, but it's on the way! See [b]Currently Working On...[/b] for more info.[/u]\nThat last note was underlined, therefore it is important!\n\n[h1]Still a Work in Progress[/h1]\nI'm still doing my best to work out kinks in the sprites. The recipes for the parts should already show up in the mech crafting station. I'll probably change this and If not, I'll maybe make it harder to craft each mech piece.\n\nThis is also my first \"real\" mod. I think its fair to say my pixel art endeavors only started this weekend (2 days ago since this mod was posted), and therefore the mod might not be as pristine as I wish it to be. I will however do my best to keep the sprites up to some standard.\n\n[h1]Currently Working On...[/h1]\n[strike][b]Leg reskins (and/or rework)[/b][/strike]\n[b]Legs for XS Mechs: Modular Edition (ETA: 2-3 days)[/b]\nI've put off working on the legs for vanilla. I will instead be working on some XS Mech: Modular Edition legs, I'll probably get those out this week so stay tuned. I've already got \"prototypes\" done, just need to polish and adjust some .frames files.\n\n[b]Sprite Body Clean/Polish (Prepping for Release)[/b]\nThe new sprites are ready and I've updated recipes/items. Two \"Legendary\" mech bodies will be obtainable from experimental blueprints. The boosters will be obtainable from high-tech blueprints (didn't want to convolute the pool of items for experimental). The original mech has been reskinned and polished and is still a default recipe.\n\n[b]Sprite Booster Clean/Polish (Prepping for Release)[/b]\nDone. Releasing with body reworks.\n\n[b]Gatling Railgun[/b]\nAn arm weapon piece. No ETA yet, but I've started initial sketches.\n\n[h1]FAQ[/h1]\n[b]XS Mechs: Modular Edition Compatibility?[/b]\nSee [b]Currently Working on...[/b]\n\n[b]There are some interesting (bad) details in the sprites...[/b]\nBleh, not a pixel artist or artist for that sake, but I'm trying my best!\n\n[b]Some of the flames look weird[/b]\nThey were rushed under the influence of wine. Will rework soon.\n\n[b]The legs are ugly[/b]\nI agree.\n\n[b]I have a suggestion![/b]\nPost it under discussions, I'd love to hear it! :)\n\n[b]I have (found) a bug![/b]\nWrite up a report in the discussions, I'll do my best to solve! :0\n\n[h1]Item IDs[/h1]\nMM4-A Wasp Body: [b]mechbodyavali[/b]\nMM4-A Wasp Boosters: [b]mechboosteravali[/b]\nMM4-A Wasp Leggings: [b]mechlegsavali[/b]",
