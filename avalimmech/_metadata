The two legendary variants of the mech are obtainable via blueprints. The mech bodies are given by experimental blueprints and the boosters by high-tech blueprints.\n\n[h1]Still a Work in Progress[/h1]\nThe mod continues to receive sprite updates and other features!\n\nThis is also my first \"real\" mod. I think its fair to say my pixel art endeavors only started this weekend (2 days ago since this mod was posted), and therefore the mod might not be as pristine as I wish it to be. I will however do my best to keep the sprites up to some standard.\n\n[h1]Currently Working On...[/h1]\n[b]Legs for XS Mechs: Modular Edition (Done)[/b]\nEverything seems fine.\n\n[b]Immunities (ETA < 1 day)[/b]\nThis should be done fairly quickly.\n\n[b]Changing Color Palettes (ETA Unknown)[/b]\nReally starting to hate myself for not keeping this in mind from the start...\n\n[i]Feature freeze from here for a while[/i]\n\nEverything beyond this point is on hold. I am a bit burnt out from stuff this week. I will take some time to clean my assets and see to it the best way to go about the next few items on this list.\n\n[b]Melee and Tools arm pieces[/b]\nAs suggested.\n\n[b]Gatling Railgun[/b]\nAn arm weapon piece. No ETA yet, but I've started initial sketches.\n\n[h1]FAQ[/h1]\n[b]XS Mechs: Modular Edition Compatibility?[/b]\nSee [b]Currently Working on...[/b]\n\n[b]There are some interesting (bad) details in the sprites...[/b]\nBleh, not a pixel artist or artist for that sake, but I'm trying my best!\n\n[b]Some of the flames look weird[/b]\nThey were rushed under the influence of wine. Will rework soon.\n\n[b]The legs are ugly[/b]\nI agree.\n\n[b]I have a suggestion![/b]\nPost it under discussions, I'd love to hear it! :)\n\n[b]I have (found) a bug![/b]\nWrite up a report in the discussions, I'll do my best to solve! :0\n\n[h1]Item IDs[/h1]\nMM4-A Wasp Body: [b]mechbodyavali[/b]\nMM4-A Wasp Boosters: [b]mechboosteravali[/b]\nMM4-A Wasp Leggings: [b]mechlegsavali[/b]\n\nMM5-AP Wasp Body: [b]mechbodyavaliproto[/b]\nMM5-AP Wasp Boosters: [b]mechboosteravaliproto[/b]\n\nMM4-N Wasp Body: [b]mechbodyavalinezo[/b]\nMM4-N Wasp Boosters: [b]mechboosteravalinezo[/b]",
