  "description" : "The MM4-A \"Wasp,\" a mech for the space-faring Avali!\n\n[b]If you use Frackin' Universe or XS Mechs: Modular Edition, read this [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/950340366/1488861734109290466/]discussion[/url][/b]!\n\n[h1]Getting Mechanized[/h1]\nThe MM4-A should already show up in the mech crafting station at the outpost. The two legendary variants of the mech are obtainable via blueprints. The mech bodies are given by experimental blueprints and the boosters by high-tech blueprints.\n\nCurrently, the MM5-AP and the MM4-N have disadvantages and advantages in regards to each other. The MM4-N is more agile (better boosters) and the MM5-AP is a bit more sturdy (better body). These are a little op at the moment and I will probably rebalance them soon.\n\n[h1]Still a Work in Progress[/h1]\nI know a lot more about modding now than I did when I started this, but I am still not a pixel artist. So spriting up things can be difficult for me at times. Because of that, I continue to update the sprites when I can. That and all the things I plan to do sometime in the DEV thread.\n\n[b]I'd like to give out a special thanks to everyone who has provided positive and constructive feedback, and also suggestions! You are my motivation for working on this and that makes you awesome in my book.[/b] \n\n[h1]Development[/h1]\nCheck out the DEV [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/950340366/1456202492168014869/]thread[/url] and the Trello board: [b]https://trello.com/b/8Q6cz3NZ[/b]\n\n[h1]FAQ[/h1]\nMoved to a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/950340366/1368380934276498558/]thread[/url] under discussions, but kept these here just in case:\n\n[b]I have a suggestion![/b]\nPost it under discussions, I'd love to hear it! :)\n\n[b]I have (found) a bug![/b]\nWrite up a report in the discussions, I'll do my best to solve! :0\n\n[h1]Item IDs[/h1]\nMM4-A Wasp Body: [b]mechbodyavali[/b]\nMM4-A Wasp Boosters: [b]mechboosteravali[/b]\nMM4-A Wasp Leggings: [b]mechlegsavali[/b]\n\nMM4-AP Wasp Body: [b]mechbodyavaliproto[/b]\nMM4-AP Wasp Boosters: [b]mechboosteravaliproto[/b]\n\nMM4-AN Wasp Body: [b]mechbodyavalinezo[/b]\nMM4-AN Wasp Boosters: [b]mechboosteravalinezo[/b]\n\n[h1]Mod ID and Name[/h1]\nID: [b]950340366[/b]\nName: [b]mechavali[/b]",
