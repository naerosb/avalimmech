# Avali Modular Mech

For general information not regarding source, check out the steam workshop [page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=950340366) and the discussions.

### Issues

Though I encourage issues to be discussed on the steam workshop page, I hold nothing against issues being posted through here.

### The Source

You're free to modify and redistribute the source in any way shape or form. However, credit should be given for any reproductions that look awefully similar to this mod (as in you took something, hardly modified it, and put it out to the world).

But honestly, for the most part, I don't quite care.

### Changelog

The changelog here details notable changes in a short and sweet manner. Always see the releases or change notes on steam for more detailed information about additions, modifications or removals.

### The Develop Branch

This branch holds all the work I am doing on the mod. You're free to use the packed mod from this branch, but you must keep in mind that work might be unpolished, incomplete or outright broken. 

Do this only if you feel courageous, curious or want to help development.
